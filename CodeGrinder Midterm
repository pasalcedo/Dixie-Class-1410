In this exercise, you will add to your Battery class a method to drain the battery.

Class Name
Battery

Method
drain()

Parameters
self : the Battery object to use
milliamps : a number, the amount of charge to remove from the battery.
Action
Removes milliamps from the charge of the object. If the new charge is less than 0, then set the charge to 0.

Only do this action of milliamps is positive, and the Battery isn't already at 0 charge.

Return Value
True if a change occurred, False otherwise.

Examples
b = Battery(3080.)
b.drain(180.) -> True
b.getCharge() -> 2900.
b.drain(0.0) -> False
b.drain(-1.0) -> False
b.drain(2800.) -> True
b.getCharge() -> 100.
b.drain(150.) -> True
b.getCharge() -> 0.
b.drain(1.) -> False
b.getCharge() -> 0.
